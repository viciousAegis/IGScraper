Keep in mind, just because you implement these hacksdoesn't necessarily mean you will lose weight  They are just steps in the right direction that can aid the process.   Remember, when it comes to fat loss, creating a calorie deficit (burning more calories than you take in via food) is always priority numero uno.  As you look on this list, you will see that these tips are all based around controlling energy balance in some way (except pizzabecause pizza is delicious ).   Smaller Plates: Using smaller plates can help with the whole well, its in front of me, I might as well eat it all conundrum.   Coffee: As long as youre only adding minimal amounts of cream/sugar or drinking it black, coffee can be a great option to curb hunger & give you a nice energy boost.   Strawberries: For reference here, a whole pound of strawberries is only 150 calories. You can eat half a pound of strawberries for 75 caloriestalk about feeling full & satisfied!  Sparkling Water: Zero calorie drinks can be a great option to hold you over between meals. Sometimes just giving yourself something different that plain water to sip on can make a noticeable difference.   Step Goals: Setting a daily step goal can help to increase daily activity levels and burn additional calories, without actually feeling like you have to add dedicated time to your day for exercise. Go for a walk, park at the back of the parking lot, get up from your desk every 30 minutes, etc.   Pizza: As surprised as you may be to see pizza make the list, it absolutely can be a fat loss hack. For many, being able to occasionally incorporate foods you enjoy (like pizza) into your plan can help big time when it comes to sustainability and actually adhering to your diet.

Widely available in many supermarket chains, Applegate's hickory-smoked, no sugar, uncured bacon contains pork, water, sea salt, and celery powder (in lieu of chemicals to cure). We give this product a green light for keto, although we'd like to see the added quality factors of pasture-raised and pesticide-free feed on this label as well. Other brands in this category include Pederson's, Wellshire, and a local farm near you! The Great Value brand (aka Walmart) gives us pause because of the pork cured with sodium phosphates, sodium erythorbate (what on earth is that???), and sodium nitrite used to preserve the product. Big Food manufacturers use chemical preservatives to enhance color and flavor, to extend shelf life, and to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria. Needless to say, these ingredients are not ideal for your body. If you're aiming for a clean, nutrient-dense, and well formulated approach to keto food, make sure to choose uncured bacon from pastured pigs. In our opinion, it's always best to support a local farm that you know is raising animals right, but the Applegate option is not a bad choice, in a pinch. ",yes,0.15871691703796387

The key to sugar cravings is balancing what your body is ACTUALLY craving (which is usually quick energy, minerals, protein or water). So to keep sugar cravings at bay dont skip meals and try adding more protein to your diet (most of us need about 90g or more depending on lifestyle). I use protein smoothies but a protein bar could be a good option too (just check the ingredients!)  Heres what happens when I want candy  I usually eat a piece of dark chocolate first. Like 1-2 squares. If that doesnt work I move over to fruit or veggies with a protein (eg. berries with Greek yogurt, carrots with hummus).   To avoid the cravings I include the healthy fats everyday  fish, avocado, nuts. And to end my day I drink herbal teas.

Its my favourite season for fashion: flannels, Jordans, jeans - cant go wrong in my books.  Dont get me wrong, I do love the summer but Im ready for this transition period.  Now that the long weekend is upon us, Here are some quick tips to avoid weight gain (notice I said weight and not fat)  1) Majority of your plate with protein. It is most filling and will keep your metabolism revving because of the high thermic effect.  2) More veggies than starches. This also helps keep you full without too many extra calories.  3) If you know what is being served, or at least have a rough idea, you can log your meal in advance. While you dont have to weigh everything out, its definitely a good idea to overestimate and guess portion sizes to the best of your ability.  4) Be okay with saying no. Family members can be the harshest people to those trying to transform their bodies. Youre allowed to say no to them. Briefly explain why youre saying no if you want to and move on from the situation. Your journey is more important than family members' expectations of what you should be doing.  You don't have to do extra workouts, you don't have to annihilate your calories this coming week.   If your scale goes up, it's definitely not fat. And it's definitely not a big deal.

3182345561432851075,"Ever heard someone dismiss intuitive eating as just eating whatever you want or giving into cravings? I'm here to tell you that this couldn't be further from the truth!  Intuitive eating is all about listening to your body's needs, developing a healthy relationship with food, and nourishing yourself in a way that feels good both physically and emotionally. Its not a diet or a strict set of rules. Instead, it is a process of self-discovery that involves tuning into your body's signals of hunger, fullness, and satisfaction, and learning to trust and honor those signals. It means letting go of strict food rules and restrictions, and instead allowing yourself to eat a wide variety of foods that support your wellbeing physically, mentally, and emotionally (aka not JUST high-nutrient foods, also foods that bring you pleasure regardless of their nutritional makeup). Intuitive eating prioritizes a healthy relationship with food, which means letting go of guilt and shame around food choices and instead approaching eating with curiosity, flexibility, and self-compassion. The beauty of intuitive eating is that it can support holistic health-- in other words, not just physical health but also mental and emotional wellbeing. Plus, people often find once they start regularly attuning to their intuition around food and movement, they often begin to discover other aspects of their intuition that perhaps they had been ignoring (like realizing they need some better boundaries at work, or in certain relationships, for example). Have you been hesitant to try eating intuitively? Why or why not? * * * * * *",No,0.15555930137634277

3181490848042456544," Before you make a food swap, let's talk cravings for a sec. You know those certain foods that just hit the spot? Creamy, crunchy, salty, sweet, and savory  they're like the VIPs of taste sensations that make us love what we eat. Identify your craving, then go from there!  You can still get that satisfaction by choosing alternatives that fit the same category. Here are some cool ideas to try: 1. Try almonds, carrots or celery instead of chips or pretzels. There is still a crunch, but the nutrients are higher in the healthy stuff. 2. Reach for flavored water instead of soda. Add a splash of fruit juice, lime, lemon, fresh fruit or mint. 3. Choose hummus or avocado instead of mayo on a sandwich. Get the creamy and moist texture with higher quality foods. 4. Munch on a sweet potato with cinnamon instead of cake. Get the sugar fix without the empty calories. 5. Enjoy some plain yogurt swirled with vanilla and honey instead of artificially flavored yogurt or ice cream. 6. Snack on grapes, apples, peaches, dried mango or other fruit instead of candy to satisfy the sweet tooth. 7. Indulge in a piece of dark chocolate or a nuts-only bar instead of a candy bar.  Plus, these swaps are not just for the health perks, but for the awesome energy boost and improved focus they bring! . . . . . .",yes,0.15781807899475098

Continuing on our recent theme of grain-free flours, we're highlighting almond flour this week. You won't be able to substitute one-for-one, since almond flour doesn't have the binding capability of gluten, and it's also higher in fat. A common guideline is to use about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of almond flour for every 1 cup of regular flour in baking recipes - however, keep in mind that you might need to adjust other ingredients like eggs, liquids, and leavening agents to achieve the desired consistency and flavor. Better yet, look for keto-specific recipes that were developed to be low-carb from the start. (Hint: The Senza Recipe Box has LOTS!)
