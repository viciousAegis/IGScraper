However, it's worth noting that store bought sauces and condiments often conceal higher than expected levels of calories, sugar, sodium, and saturated fat, which may impact your health goals. It's important to note that serving sizes of condiments can vary depending on the product, so be sure you watch your serving size.

3190519680192215501,"Have you heard that electrolytes are important for a successful transition to ketosis? The body needs these minerals to regulate its metabolism. But as we make the metabolic switch to burning fat for energy, the body lets go of retained water, flushing sodium, potassium, and magnesium out with it. The result is electrolyte imbalance and flu-like symptoms that can be easily avoided with proper supplementation. Experts suggest 5000mg sodium, 1000mg potassium, and 400mg magnesium (in glycinate or malate form) per day. Although you can take the one at a time, there are several all-in-one options designed specifically for keto. Redmond Re-Lyte is one of these. Sweetened with stevia, it contains 810mg sodium, 400mg potassium citrate and 50mg magnesium malate & glycinate per 6g scoop. To compare with another brand, one Liquid I.V. stick pack (6g) contains 11g of added sugars (the first ingredient on the list, followed by dextrose and citric acid) and only 500mg sodium, 370mg potassium, and zero magnesium.

I also understand if youre a body builder or are going for physique only, this may be something you HAVE TO DO. Or maybe you have a condition where you absolutely cannot eat certain foods. But In this post, I am talking about your average person who just wants to lose weight, gain muscle, get healthy or live longer. Food and culture go hand-in-hand. Food and social activities go together too. I know for me, certain food are nostalgica an comforting. Even though they may not be the healthiest for me, to be able to have them in moderation is super important. Food can bring people together and it can absolutely help make you happy. I used to restrict so much for so long, and all that caused me was bulimia and emotional trauma, feeling guilty and negative self talk when I wasnt able to adhere. What if we stopped all this nonsense and just tried our best? What if we practiced restraint when necessary and made the decisions to eat these nostalgic foods we crave when we feel good about doing so? What if we listened to our body, instead of our head? Ill tell you, we would become the most healthiest version of ourselves because not only would we be choosing physical health, we would be choosing to honor our humanity as well. We would have less bungees, left anorexics, less bulimics and less mental health issues.

They go from eating foods they like to going for a completely different food that they find almost unpalatable. If you really don't like a food, will you be able to sustain this long term? I doubt it. Take the burgers in the picture of instance, both very similar but there is over 30 Calories a difference in them. Now this may not sound a lot, but it is significant. If every food you eat was 30 Calories less than your usual food, you would quickly have reduced your Calories, without eating foods you really don't enjoy. So think to yourself, do you need to make huge changes you can't sustain, or small changes that will add up? You know the foods you like the most, so this is another option to consider.

Choose hummus or avocado instead of mayo on a sandwich. Get the creamy and moist texture with higher quality foods. 4. Munch on a sweet potato with cinnamon instead of cake. Get the sugar fix without the empty calories. 5. Enjoy some plain yogurt swirled with vanilla and honey instead of artificially flavored yogurt or ice cream. 6.

Iodine deficiency can lead to thyroid disorders, developmental issues in children, and cognitive impairments. Iodized salt is a reliable and convenient source of iodine, helping to prevent iodine deficiency disorders. Rock Salt (Sendha Namak): While rock salt, often marketed as Himalayan salt, has gained popularity for its natural pink color and perceived health benefits, it's important to note that it does not provide a significant amount of iodine. Rock salt primarily contains sodium chloride and trace minerals, but it lacks the iodine fortification that is crucial for preventing iodine deficiency. Key Takeaway: Iodine is an essential nutrient that supports thyroid function and overall health. Choosing iodized salt as part of your diet ensures you're getting this important micronutrient. While rock salt may offer unique minerals and flavors, it's not a reliable source of iodine. To maintain proper thyroid health and prevent iodine deficiency, opt for iodized salt in your diet. However, it's also important to moderate salt consumption overall, regardless of the type of salt you choose. High sodium intake can contribute to hypertension and other health issues. Balancing your diet with a variety of nutrient-rich foods and using iodized salt in moderation can help you maintain optimal health.

3175636983551220931,"Eating healthy is not always easy, but it can be the smartest decision you make. Here are my top reasons to include more nutrient-packed foods in your diet:  INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY: Your brain needs quality fuel to run efficiently. Improving your diet with nutritious foods and supplements can help you focus better and work more efficiently, which can lead to promotions and raises. SAVE MONEY ON HEALTH AND LIFE INSURANCE: Health coverage discounts and life insurance premiums are partially based on how healthy you are. A healthier diet and weight can significantly lower your costs. ENHANCE MOOD: What you eat has an impact on your brain, including the parts that regulate mood. Regular, proper nutrition can help you feel better overall on most days. REGULATE WEIGHT: Replacing unhealthy foods with healthy ones can help you lose weight and save money. The average obese person spends $3000 more on health care annually than a normal-weight counterpart. LIVE LONGER: A healthy diet that includes lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, healthy proteins, and plenty of omega-3 fats can help you live longer. In closing, treating your body well is important. Your body is your temple, and it continuously treats you well. Feed it with whole nutrient foods that are good for your body, and your body will thank you.",yes,0.1460421085357666
