The lean beef mince is over 100 calories less - and thats per 100g... so the difference would be even more significant if you were having a larger serving size! Ido however notice a taste difference between the two, the 3 star beef mince noticeably tastes more fattier and flavoursome (hence, it has OVER double the amount of fat content). However i do still like and enjoy the 5 star beef mince. The leaner beef mince IS slightly more expensive, however provides more nutritional value and significantly less calories & fats soi can justify buying the leaner option.
