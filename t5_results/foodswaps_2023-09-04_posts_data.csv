They go from eating foods they like to going for a completely different food that they find almost unpalatable. If you really don't like a food, will you be able to sustain this long term? I doubt it. Take the burgers in the picture of instance, both very similar but there is over 30 Calories a difference in them. Now this may not sound a lot, but it is significant. If every food you eat was 30 Calories less than your usual food, you would quickly have reduced your Calories, without eating foods you really don't enjoy. So think to yourself, do you need to make huge changes you can't sustain, or small changes that will add up? You know the foods you like the most, so this is another option to consider.

Choose hummus or avocado instead of mayo on a sandwich. Get the creamy and moist texture with higher quality foods. 4. Munch on a sweet potato with cinnamon instead of cake. Get the sugar fix without the empty calories. 5. Enjoy some plain yogurt swirled with vanilla and honey instead of artificially flavored yogurt or ice cream. 6.

A common guideline is to use about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of almond flour for every 1 cup of regular flour in baking recipes - however, keep in mind that you might need to adjust other ingredients like eggs, liquids, and leavening agents to achieve the desired consistency and flavor. Better yet, look for keto-specific recipes that were developed to be low-carb from the start. (Hint: The Senza Recipe Box has LOTS!)

Iodine deficiency can lead to thyroid disorders, developmental issues in children, and cognitive impairments. Iodized salt is a reliable and convenient source of iodine, helping to prevent iodine deficiency disorders. Rock Salt (Sendha Namak): While rock salt, often marketed as Himalayan salt, has gained popularity for its natural pink color and perceived health benefits, it's important to note that it does not provide a significant amount of iodine. Rock salt primarily contains sodium chloride and trace minerals, but it lacks the iodine fortification that is crucial for preventing iodine deficiency. Key Takeaway: Iodine is an essential nutrient that supports thyroid function and overall health. Choosing iodized salt as part of your diet ensures you're getting this important micronutrient. While rock salt may offer unique minerals and flavors, it's not a reliable source of iodine. To maintain proper thyroid health and prevent iodine deficiency, opt for iodized salt in your diet. However, it's also important to moderate salt consumption overall, regardless of the type of salt you choose. High sodium intake can contribute to hypertension and other health issues. Balancing your diet with a variety of nutrient-rich foods and using iodized salt in moderation can help you maintain optimal health.

3175636983551220931,"Eating healthy is not always easy, but it can be the smartest decision you make. Here are my top reasons to include more nutrient-packed foods in your diet:  INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY: Your brain needs quality fuel to run efficiently. Improving your diet with nutritious foods and supplements can help you focus better and work more efficiently, which can lead to promotions and raises. SAVE MONEY ON HEALTH AND LIFE INSURANCE: Health coverage discounts and life insurance premiums are partially based on how healthy you are. A healthier diet and weight can significantly lower your costs. ENHANCE MOOD: What you eat has an impact on your brain, including the parts that regulate mood. Regular, proper nutrition can help you feel better overall on most days. REGULATE WEIGHT: Replacing unhealthy foods with healthy ones can help you lose weight and save money. The average obese person spends $3000 more on health care annually than a normal-weight counterpart. LIVE LONGER: A healthy diet that includes lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, healthy proteins, and plenty of omega-3 fats can help you live longer. In closing, treating your body well is important. Your body is your temple, and it continuously treats you well. Feed it with whole nutrient foods that are good for your body, and your body will thank you.",yes,0.1553809642791748

One of the best places to start is with healthy fats.  Healthy fats, as part of a balanced meal including quality proteins and nutrient rich carbs are important for kids growing and developing body and brains.  We try to serve a healthy fat at each meal and these are some of our favorite ways to do it.  A whole avocado can see intimidating but a few small chucks of avocado are reasonable and delicious.  Olives in your lunchbox or olives as part of dinner add some salty flavor that is delicious.  - Swap the seed oils for healthy fats like grass fed butter, ghee and tallow to add extra healthy fat and nutrients to your meal.  Raw cheese is on of our families favorite healthy fats!  Yogurt is great for extra protein, but if you are going for extra fat, try the plain full fat grass fed yogurt. Top it with raw honey or fruit for an extra flavor punch.  - Grass fed butter or extra virgin olive oil and sea salt on pasta is delicious.  - Swap out your plant based milks that likely contain seed oils with a full fat simple coconut milk or a full fat grass-fed milk!  - Skip the lean ground beef.

3175290044784952809,"Adding baby corn to salads is delicious and lower in carbohydrates than regular corn. Enjoying it in a salad is one of my new favourite ways to enjoy because it absorbs the dressing better and doesnt spike my blood sugar. Baby corn is a miniature version of sweet corn that is harvested before it matures and develops into the larger, more familiar ears of corn. It's commonly used in various cuisines for its tender texture and mild flavor. Baby corn is typically harvested when the corn plant is very young, before the kernels have fully developed and become starchy. As a result, it has a crunchy texture and a subtle, slightly sweet taste. The reason baby corn is lower in carbohydrates compared to mature corn lies in its stage of growth. Carbohydrates in corn primarily come from the sugars and starches present in the kernels. As corn matures, these sugars and starches accumulate, contributing to its higher carbohydrate content. Baby corn has less time to accumulate these sugars and starches, which results in a lower carbohydrate content per unit of weight. Those following a keto diet can enjoy it as well! Due to its mild flavor and unique texture, baby corn is often used in stir-fries, salads, soups, and other dishes where its crunchiness adds an appealing contrast. It's also a popular choice for appetizers, garnishes, and finger foods. You can purchase the canned or fresh baby corn in grocery stores. If purchasing it fresh, be sure to cook it before adding it to a salad. For this version of salad, I used my broccoli salad recipe and added the corn the next day when I was enjoying the leftovers. The baby corn soaked up the excess dressing and added a lovely texture and taste that impressed me more than I was expecting! I garnished with a sprinkle of sriracha seasoning and it was even better this way. Do you like baby corn?",yes,0.15192914009094238
3175158850670404914,"Lets talk about why organic matters. 1. When foods are grown with pesticides, these toxic chemicals infiltrate the soil and water, leading to nutrient-depleted crops. Crops get their nutrients from the soil, so if were poisoning the soil, crops become less healthy for us to eat. 2. The pesticides on these crops are harmful for us to ingest. According to the World Health Organization, the effects of pesticide residue include cancer, adverse reproductive effects, immune system dysregulation, and nervous system dysregulation. Pesticides aso disrupt the microbiome. 3. Pesticide-sprayed crops are often genetically modified to be resistant to the strong chemicals that kill pests and other critters.

Just like when you're eating at home, the key to eating healthy while eating out is to make sure you have a protein, a color, and a carb on your plate. Steakhouses Ordering a leaner cut of meat is one way that can help reduce the fat in the meal. Swapping your side of mashed potatoes for a baked potato also helps lower the fat content as these usually contain milk, cream, and butter. Ordering a side of vegetables helps add color to your plate as well as nutrients and fiber Next, lets talk about Italian/Mexican restaurants. Many dishes in these restaurants are deep fried or pan fried. Picking food options that have the words boiled, steamed, or roasted instead is a great way to reduce the amount of calories in your meal since oil is high in fat. You can also try asking for the dressing or sauces that come with meals on the side. This allows you to control how much you are adding and reduce the calorie and fat intake. You can also look for vegetable based sauces rather than creamy/rich sauces. Next up lets talk about pizza. Adding vegetables as a topping adds more nutrients and fiber to your meals which keeps you fuller for longer. Adding a protein as well as a topping or side is a great way to add more protein. Portion size is also an important point to keep in mind as well. Try ordering one slice and a side salad as well to decrease calories and fat while still enjoying pizza. Finally, lets talk about sub shops. Adding on more veggies like onions, pickles, bell peppers, and more can help increase the nutrients and fiber to your sub! Sub shops also typically have different types of bread! Trying out the whole grain or even multigrain options will give you extra fiber, nutrients, and keep you fuller for longer.

When you get lab tested and you take the right supplements, they can accelerate your healing and get you feeling better faster. That said, do not dismiss the power of your day-to-day diet! Think of your diet and your supplements like tools in a tool belt. Some tools actually work better when used together. Here are my TOP diet tips for maximizing mitochondrial function and boosting energy alongside your supplements  1. Eat fresh fruits and vegetables with every meal. 2. Get your Omega-3s in. Fatty acids help build your mitochondrias membranes which allows better control of what comes in and out of the mitochondria. 3. Reduce toxic, inflammatory foods. For most people, that means cutting way back on gluten, dairy, sugars, flours, and trans fats. Notice I didnt say complete elimination. Want more food tips?

We KNOW there are much healthier options, we know there are better foods out there to eat, but sometimes it just doesn't work out that way for people. Some people work late nights, some people have little options in their fridge and head to their freezers. Sometimes people just want to eat something convenient. If you find yourself in a situation where you have hit the freezer, well there is no point in ruining your day's fat loss efforts with a high Calorie meal, instead think about this lower Calorie, lower cost option.
