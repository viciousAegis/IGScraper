Widely available in many supermarket chains, Applegate's hickory-smoked, no sugar, uncured bacon contains pork, water, sea salt, and celery powder (in lieu of chemicals to cure). We give this product a green light for keto, although we'd like to see the added quality factors of pasture-raised and pesticide-free feed on this label as well. Other brands in this category include Pederson's, Wellshire, and a local farm near you! The Great Value brand (aka Walmart) gives us pause because of the pork cured with sodium phosphates, sodium erythorbate (what on earth is that???), and sodium nitrite used to preserve the product. Big Food manufacturers use chemical preservatives to enhance color and flavor, to extend shelf life, and to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria. Needless to say, these ingredients are not ideal for your body. If you're aiming for a clean, nutrient-dense, and well formulated approach to keto food, make sure to choose uncured bacon from pastured pigs. In our opinion, it's always best to support a local farm that you know is raising animals right, but the Applegate option is not a bad choice, in a pinch. ",yes,0.1567542552947998

It has a slightly sweet and nutty flavor and is an excellent low carb alternative to traditional pasta. Cauliflower Rice: Cauliflower rice is made by grating cauliflower into tiny rice like pieces. It is a great low carb alternative to rice and can also be used in place of pasta in dishes like stir fries or salads or as a risotto sub. Eggplant Lasagna: Eggplant slices can be used in place of traditional lasagna noodles to create a delicious and low carb version of this classic dish.

Iodine deficiency can lead to thyroid disorders, developmental issues in children, and cognitive impairments. Iodized salt is a reliable and convenient source of iodine, helping to prevent iodine deficiency disorders. Rock Salt (Sendha Namak): While rock salt, often marketed as Himalayan salt, has gained popularity for its natural pink color and perceived health benefits, it's important to note that it does not provide a significant amount of iodine. Rock salt primarily contains sodium chloride and trace minerals, but it lacks the iodine fortification that is crucial for preventing iodine deficiency. Key Takeaway: Iodine is an essential nutrient that supports thyroid function and overall health. Choosing iodized salt as part of your diet ensures you're getting this important micronutrient. While rock salt may offer unique minerals and flavors, it's not a reliable source of iodine. To maintain proper thyroid health and prevent iodine deficiency, opt for iodized salt in your diet. However, it's also important to moderate salt consumption overall, regardless of the type of salt you choose. High sodium intake can contribute to hypertension and other health issues. Balancing your diet with a variety of nutrient-rich foods and using iodized salt in moderation can help you maintain optimal health.

Here are my top reasons to include more nutrient-packed foods in your diet:  INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY: Your brain needs quality fuel to run efficiently. Improving your diet with nutritious foods and supplements can help you focus better and work more efficiently, which can lead to promotions and raises. SAVE MONEY ON HEALTH AND LIFE INSURANCE: Health coverage discounts and life insurance premiums are partially based on how healthy you are. A healthier diet and weight can significantly lower your costs. ENHANCE MOOD: What you eat has an impact on your brain, including the parts that regulate mood. Regular, proper nutrition can help you feel better overall on most days. REGULATE WEIGHT: Replacing unhealthy foods with healthy ones can help you lose weight and save money. The average obese person spends $3000 more on health care annually than a normal-weight counterpart. LIVE LONGER: A healthy diet that includes lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, healthy proteins, and plenty of omega-3 fats can help you live longer. In closing, treating your body well is important.

Enjoying it in a salad is one of my new favourite ways to enjoy because it absorbs the dressing better and doesnt spike my blood sugar. Baby corn is a miniature version of sweet corn that is harvested before it matures and develops into the larger, more familiar ears of corn. It's commonly used in various cuisines for its tender texture and mild flavor. Baby corn is typically harvested when the corn plant is very young, before the kernels have fully developed and become starchy. As a result, it has a crunchy texture and a subtle, slightly sweet taste. The reason baby corn is lower in carbohydrates compared to mature corn lies in its stage of growth. Carbohydrates in corn primarily come from the sugars and starches present in the kernels. As corn matures, these sugars and starches accumulate, contributing to its higher carbohydrate content. Baby corn has less time to accumulate these sugars and starches, which results in a lower carbohydrate content per unit of weight. Those following a keto diet can enjoy it as well! Due to its mild flavor and unique texture, baby corn is often used in stir-fries, salads, soups, and other dishes where its crunchiness adds an appealing contrast. It's also a popular choice for appetizers, garnishes, and finger foods. You can purchase the canned or fresh baby corn in grocery stores. If purchasing it fresh, be sure to cook it before adding it to a salad. For this version of salad, I used my broccoli salad recipe and added the corn the next day when I was enjoying the leftovers. The baby corn soaked up the excess dressing and added a lovely texture and taste that impressed me more than I was expecting! I garnished with a sprinkle of sriracha seasoning and it was even better this way. Do you like baby corn?",yes,0.15730810165405273

Pesticides aso disrupt the microbiome. 3. Pesticide-sprayed crops are often genetically modified to be resistant to the strong chemicals that kill pests and other critters.

Truth is it's never been easier . GREED was a huge issue for the old me I loved Mars, and I still do But a standard bar was never enough for me. When they brought out the King-size version I was over the moon. Sadly I had no concept of how they would see my weekly calories EXPLODE! I would easily have eaten 2 in one sitting .. Learning how food actually works and eating better for the main part of the day helped me exercise the CONTROL I wrongly assumed I'd never know.

3172136056312619756,"Food Swap Friday: Pizza  I did some digging to find the healthiest fast food pizza, and to my surprise, many sources say its Dominos! I was very impressed with their website! They even have a Cal-O-Meter and Lighter Options feature. The thinner crust pizza is the best option, and of course adding veggies and lean meats for toppings will help keep fat lower and protein up! The only real difference between a large slice of thin crust and hand tossed was the calories went up to 280 and carbs doubled. Depending on the day you want to eat pizza, its ok to have all the carbs on our strength training days! All in all, pizza is one of those foods that we shouldnt eat everyday, and calories and fats can quickly add up with each topping. The best option would be to eat ONE slice and not overdo it or make your own pizza at home so all ingredients are known and controlled. Not to mention, its fun! Get creative.. try cauliflower crust, different sauces and toppings!",No,0.1843430995941162

Alleen vandaag heb ik een vrijbrief want dit is de uitzondering dat ik iets 'ongezonds' kies. Lees: want normaal mag ik geen Mac van mijn dieet. Daarom verdien ik dit. Maandag begin ik gewoon opnieuw.  Herken je deze dieetgedachten?  Waar het om gaat, is dat je op elk moment van de dag een keuze hebt:  In wat, waar, hoe veel en wanneer je eet (wortels, brood, sushi of Mac)  In wat je drinkt  In wanneer je tijd en rust neemt voor jezelf  In hoe je je (vrije) tijd indeelt  Met wie je (het liefst) omgaat  In hoe en wanneer je nee zegt tegen die kleffe kaas en cocktailnootjes bij de borrel. En dus ook tegen de sociale verwachting(en). Jij hebt de regie.  En zoals je ziet: ook bij de Mac kun je prima 'normaal' eten in plaats van ongezond. De ene keuze is de ander niet. De kunst is om dat oordeel en die dieetgedachten te laten voor wat ze zijn. En ruimte te geven aan jouw -bewuste- keuzes en waar jij je goed bij voelt. Waarbij een Mcmenu prima in jouw eetpatroon past.  Zin in om zonder gevoel van spijt naar de Mac te kunnen gaan? Genieten van het allerlekkerste zonder door te slaan en het gevoel van ''ik verdien het nu, want ik had een zware dag''? Je bent ook gezellig wanneer je nee zegt. Of dit rechtermenu neemt bij de Mac. Want jij bent jij en dat is meer dan genoeg.  It is up to you.  Weten hoe je dat gevoel van regie en meer dan genoeg zijn ervaart zodat je juist dan duurzaam afvalt? DM  en we plannen gelijk een vrijblijvende 1:1 kennismaking in. Wat kies jij: het linker of rechtermenu?  Of liever helemaal geen Mac? Let me know in de comment(s).",No,0.16962814331054688
