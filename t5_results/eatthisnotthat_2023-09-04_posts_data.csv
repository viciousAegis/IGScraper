Its my favourite season for fashion: flannels, Jordans, jeans - cant go wrong in my books.  Dont get me wrong, I do love the summer but Im ready for this transition period.  Now that the long weekend is upon us, Here are some quick tips to avoid weight gain (notice I said weight and not fat)  1) Majority of your plate with protein. It is most filling and will keep your metabolism revving because of the high thermic effect.  2) More veggies than starches. This also helps keep you full without too many extra calories.  3) If you know what is being served, or at least have a rough idea, you can log your meal in advance. While you dont have to weigh everything out, its definitely a good idea to overestimate and guess portion sizes to the best of your ability.  4) Be okay with saying no. Family members can be the harshest people to those trying to transform their bodies. Youre allowed to say no to them. Briefly explain why youre saying no if you want to and move on from the situation. Your journey is more important than family members' expectations of what you should be doing.  You don't have to do extra workouts, you don't have to annihilate your calories this coming week.   If your scale goes up, it's definitely not fat. And it's definitely not a big deal. Things will regulate so long as you get back to normal (training, eating, sleeping).   Spend time with your favourite people and enjoy the weekend.        ",yes,0.15200471878051758
3182345561432851075,"Ever heard someone dismiss intuitive eating as just eating whatever you want or giving into cravings? I'm here to tell you that this couldn't be further from the truth!  Intuitive eating is all about listening to your body's needs, developing a healthy relationship with food, and nourishing yourself in a way that feels good both physically and emotionally. Its not a diet or a strict set of rules. Instead, it is a process of self-discovery that involves tuning into your body's signals of hunger, fullness, and satisfaction, and learning to trust and honor those signals. It means letting go of strict food rules and restrictions, and instead allowing yourself to eat a wide variety of foods that support your wellbeing physically, mentally, and emotionally (aka not JUST high-nutrient foods, also foods that bring you pleasure regardless of their nutritional makeup). Intuitive eating prioritizes a healthy relationship with food, which means letting go of guilt and shame around food choices and instead approaching eating with curiosity, flexibility, and self-compassion. The beauty of intuitive eating is that it can support holistic health-- in other words, not just physical health but also mental and emotional wellbeing. Plus, people often find once they start regularly attuning to their intuition around food and movement, they often begin to discover other aspects of their intuition that perhaps they had been ignoring (like realizing they need some better boundaries at work, or in certain relationships, for example). Have you been hesitant to try eating intuitively? Why or why not? * * * * * *",No,0.15350675582885742

Keep in mind, just because you implement these hacksdoesn't necessarily mean you will lose weight  They are just steps in the right direction that can aid the process.   Remember, when it comes to fat loss, creating a calorie deficit (burning more calories than you take in via food) is always priority numero uno.  As you look on this list, you will see that these tips are all based around controlling energy balance in some way (except pizzabecause pizza is delicious ).   Smaller Plates: Using smaller plates can help with the whole well, its in front of me, I might as well eat it all conundrum.   Coffee: As long as youre only adding minimal amounts of cream/sugar or drinking it black, coffee can be a great option to curb hunger & give you a nice energy boost.   Strawberries: For reference here, a whole pound of strawberries is only 150 calories. You can eat half a pound of strawberries for 75 caloriestalk about feeling full & satisfied!  Sparkling Water: Zero calorie drinks can be a great option to hold you over between meals. Sometimes just giving yourself something different that plain water to sip on can make a noticeable difference.   Step Goals: Setting a daily step goal can help to increase daily activity levels and burn additional calories, without actually feeling like you have to add dedicated time to your day for exercise. Go for a walk, park at the back of the parking lot, get up from your desk every 30 minutes, etc.   Pizza: As surprised as you may be to see pizza make the list, it absolutely can be a fat loss hack.

Creamy, crunchy, salty, sweet, and savory  they're like the VIPs of taste sensations that make us love what we eat. Identify your craving, then go from there!  You can still get that satisfaction by choosing alternatives that fit the same category. Here are some cool ideas to try: 1. Try almonds, carrots or celery instead of chips or pretzels. There is still a crunch, but the nutrients are higher in the healthy stuff. 2. Reach for flavored water instead of soda. Add a splash of fruit juice, lime, lemon, fresh fruit or mint. 3. Choose hummus or avocado instead of mayo on a sandwich. Get the creamy and moist texture with higher quality foods. 4. Munch on a sweet potato with cinnamon instead of cake. Get the sugar fix without the empty calories. 5. Enjoy some plain yogurt swirled with vanilla and honey instead of artificially flavored yogurt or ice cream. 6. Snack on grapes, apples, peaches, dried mango or other fruit instead of candy to satisfy the sweet tooth. 7. Indulge in a piece of dark chocolate or a nuts-only bar instead of a candy bar.
