Our friends who are gluten and dairy free dont have to miss out on delicious food! Also good to note that many recipes are already gluten free and dairy free, they just arent listed when you do a search. Or, are easy to substitute either the gluten or the dairy. Often if the flour and dairy ingredients are in lesser proportions compared to other ingredients doing a substitution is reasonably successful. For cows milk - almond, coconut or soy milk. For regular yoghurt - try coconut or soy yogurt. For flours - GF flour obviously. The Thermomix also makes it super easy to mill your own nut, chickpea, buckwheat and lentil flours.

Use cauliflower rice instead of traditional rice for a low-carb alternative, or try zucchini noodles (zoodles) instead of pasta for a lighter, more nutrient-dense meal.

For quite a few of my clients, rice is NOT the safe food. Rice is high in starches (simple sugars stuck together). Many of my clients suffer with gut issues like SIBO + IBS, and complex starches can create BIG problems like:  painful bloating an inability to lay down at night due to reflux  burping or stubborn constipation. If you cant eat rice, try these instead: Cauliflower Rice - made infamous by the Keto diet, cauliflower can become almost anything, even rice! Cut it into small florets + blitz in blender intermittently until you reach rice consistency. In a Thermomix, that's 1 second on speed 6. Fry it off to reduce moisture + destroy the goitrogens in cauliflower (thyroid inhibiting). Quinoa - a pseudo grain, is best to soaked in water overnight or until they sprout (~ 24 hrs) BEFORE you cook them, improving nutrient availability + digestibility. I love the tricolour quinoa for the extra polyphenols. Konjac Rice - Another one made popular by Keto diet. Made from a tuber, low in carbs + well tolerated by SIBO + IBS people. Its also prebiotic + is great for growing Lactobacillus in the gut. Black or Red Rice - sometimes not all rice causes problems. The starchier the rice, the more problematic. Many of my clients find that black rice or red rice is actually no problem at all. And again, gives an extra hit of polyphenols.

Ask for modifications: Don't be afraid to ask for modifications such as no butter, sauce on the side, swap the bun for a lettuce wrap, etc. 3. Portion control: Try to order smaller portions or split a meal with someone else to reduce the number of calories you consume. 4. Avoid fried and processed foods: Opt for grilled, baked, or roasted dishes instead of fried or processed ones. 5. Watch out for sauces and dressings: These can often be high in calories and unhealthy fats, so ask for them on the side or choose a lighter dressing option. 6. Choose water or unsweetened beverages: Avoid sugary drinks and choose water or unsweetened tea or coffee instead. 7. Be mindful of dessert: If you want to indulge in dessert, share it with someone else or choose a lighter option such as fresh fruit.

3043380667056426663,"This week's Smart Food Swap is a flavored yogurt showdown: Two Good vs. Yoplait! When you go full keto, you'll want to skip the added sugars and thickeners found in most flavored yogurts. For example, Yoplait's Original French Vanilla version lists low fat milk and sugar as the first two ingredients, with modified food starch and tapioca starch also on the list for a whopping 28NC per 6 oz container and only 5g of protein. Two Good has become a popular choice across the Senza community because it uses stevia to sweeten instead of sugar. Two Good yogurt contains fewer carbs (3NC) and more protein (12g) per 5.3 oz serving than the conventional brands that most of us grew up eating. Another Keto Yogurt strategy is to avoid flavored products all together and buy full-fat plain Greek yogurt. Or with a little patience, you can DIY your own yogurt at home for the cleanest option of all - and this opens up the possibility of using raw milk that comes directly from a local farm. Just sayin'...  Having your yogurt with some toppings like berries & nuts? Log it on Senza with our Yogurt Bowl constructor.
