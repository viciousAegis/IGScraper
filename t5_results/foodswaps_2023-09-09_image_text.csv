The macros are also quite similar, however the Sanitarium brand contains a little bit more protein & slightly less fats, carbs and significantly less sodium. Another reason as to why i make this swap - the Sanitarium natural peanut butter contains 100% peanuts & nothing else. so yes it contains fats as this is due to the natural fats in peanuts. However, the Bega brand peanut butter is processed and also contains ingredients such as vegetable oil (unhealthy fat). sugar & salt. So the Sanitarium brand contains much more nutritional value.",yes,0.1508951187133789

The lean beef mince is over 100 calories less - and thats per 100g... so the difference would be even more significant if you were having a larger serving size! Ido however notice a taste difference between the two, the 3 star beef mince noticeably tastes more fattier and flavoursome (hence, it has OVER double the amount of fat content). However i do still like and enjoy the 5 star beef mince. The leaner beef mince IS slightly more expensive, however provides more nutritional value and significantly less calories & fats soi can justify buying the leaner option.
