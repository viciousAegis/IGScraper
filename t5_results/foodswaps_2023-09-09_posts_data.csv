Widely available in many supermarket chains, Applegate's hickory-smoked, no sugar, uncured bacon contains pork, water, sea salt, and celery powder (in lieu of chemicals to cure). We give this product a green light for keto, although we'd like to see the added quality factors of pasture-raised and pesticide-free feed on this label as well. Other brands in this category include Pederson's, Wellshire, and a local farm near you! The Great Value brand (aka Walmart) gives us pause because of the pork cured with sodium phosphates, sodium erythorbate (what on earth is that???), and sodium nitrite used to preserve the product. Big Food manufacturers use chemical preservatives to enhance color and flavor, to extend shelf life, and to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria. Needless to say, these ingredients are not ideal for your body. If you're aiming for a clean, nutrient-dense, and well formulated approach to keto food, make sure to choose uncured bacon from pastured pigs. In our opinion, it's always best to support a local farm that you know is raising animals right, but the Applegate option is not a bad choice, in a pinch. ",yes,0.15060901641845703

Continuing on our recent theme of grain-free flours, we're highlighting almond flour this week. You won't be able to substitute one-for-one, since almond flour doesn't have the binding capability of gluten, and it's also higher in fat. A common guideline is to use about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of almond flour for every 1 cup of regular flour in baking recipes - however, keep in mind that you might need to adjust other ingredients like eggs, liquids, and leavening agents to achieve the desired consistency and flavor. Better yet, look for keto-specific recipes that were developed to be low-carb from the start. (Hint: The Senza Recipe Box has LOTS!)

Iodine deficiency can lead to thyroid disorders, developmental issues in children, and cognitive impairments. Iodized salt is a reliable and convenient source of iodine, helping to prevent iodine deficiency disorders. Rock Salt (Sendha Namak): While rock salt, often marketed as Himalayan salt, has gained popularity for its natural pink color and perceived health benefits, it's important to note that it does not provide a significant amount of iodine. Rock salt primarily contains sodium chloride and trace minerals, but it lacks the iodine fortification that is crucial for preventing iodine deficiency. Key Takeaway: Iodine is an essential nutrient that supports thyroid function and overall health. Choosing iodized salt as part of your diet ensures you're getting this important micronutrient. While rock salt may offer unique minerals and flavors, it's not a reliable source of iodine. To maintain proper thyroid health and prevent iodine deficiency, opt for iodized salt in your diet. However, it's also important to moderate salt consumption overall, regardless of the type of salt you choose. High sodium intake can contribute to hypertension and other health issues. Balancing your diet with a variety of nutrient-rich foods and using iodized salt in moderation can help you maintain optimal health.

Here are my top reasons to include more nutrient-packed foods in your diet:  INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY: Your brain needs quality fuel to run efficiently. Improving your diet with nutritious foods and supplements can help you focus better and work more efficiently, which can lead to promotions and raises. SAVE MONEY ON HEALTH AND LIFE INSURANCE: Health coverage discounts and life insurance premiums are partially based on how healthy you are. A healthier diet and weight can significantly lower your costs. ENHANCE MOOD: What you eat has an impact on your brain, including the parts that regulate mood. Regular, proper nutrition can help you feel better overall on most days. REGULATE WEIGHT: Replacing unhealthy foods with healthy ones can help you lose weight and save money. The average obese person spends $3000 more on health care annually than a normal-weight counterpart. LIVE LONGER: A healthy diet that includes lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, healthy proteins, and plenty of omega-3 fats can help you live longer. In closing, treating your body well is important.

Enjoying it in a salad is one of my new favourite ways to enjoy because it absorbs the dressing better and doesnt spike my blood sugar. Baby corn is a miniature version of sweet corn that is harvested before it matures and develops into the larger, more familiar ears of corn. It's commonly used in various cuisines for its tender texture and mild flavor. Baby corn is typically harvested when the corn plant is very young, before the kernels have fully developed and become starchy. As a result, it has a crunchy texture and a subtle, slightly sweet taste. The reason baby corn is lower in carbohydrates compared to mature corn lies in its stage of growth. Carbohydrates in corn primarily come from the sugars and starches present in the kernels. As corn matures, these sugars and starches accumulate, contributing to its higher carbohydrate content. Baby corn has less time to accumulate these sugars and starches, which results in a lower carbohydrate content per unit of weight. Those following a keto diet can enjoy it as well! Due to its mild flavor and unique texture, baby corn is often used in stir-fries, salads, soups, and other dishes where its crunchiness adds an appealing contrast. It's also a popular choice for appetizers, garnishes, and finger foods. You can purchase the canned or fresh baby corn in grocery stores. If purchasing it fresh, be sure to cook it before adding it to a salad. For this version of salad, I used my broccoli salad recipe and added the corn the next day when I was enjoying the leftovers. The baby corn soaked up the excess dressing and added a lovely texture and taste that impressed me more than I was expecting! I garnished with a sprinkle of sriracha seasoning and it was even better this way. Do you like baby corn?",yes,0.14782094955444336

Crops get their nutrients from the soil, so if were poisoning the soil, crops become less healthy for us to eat. 2. The pesticides on these crops are harmful for us to ingest. According to the World Health Organization, the effects of pesticide residue include cancer, adverse reproductive effects, immune system dysregulation, and nervous system dysregulation. Pesticides aso disrupt the microbiome. 3. Pesticide-sprayed crops are often genetically modified to be resistant to the strong chemicals that kill pests and other critters.

What if instead..you worded things differently in your mind? I want to lose weight for my health, and my body WANTS to lose the weight? This (article of clothing)might not look great right now, but I WILL fit back into it. Im going to set attainable goals.2 pounds at a time.instead of thinking I need to lose 20 pounds by Halloween. Im going to stop letting an excuse like menopause, an upcoming trip, or an upcoming birthday celebration for a friend, set me back. Im going to do some kind of movement.even just walking, a few times a week. Im going to start trying new ways to prepare veggies, so Im not bored. I can always throw veggies in a pan and make a stir fry..or make a huge salad with a salad kit base, and add some cooked protein. What goals (not excuses)can you set for yourself today? If youre bored with your meals, go on Instagram and start following people who seem to be making yummy food that looks good to you. You can always swap healthier lower cal options. When I see pasta or rice dishes, I immediately think of pasta swaps. Shredded kohlrabi, hearts of palm, spaghetti squash, zoodles..get creative, and you wont get bored. Enjoy the process, and you will reach your goals. And remember to speak kinder to yourself..",No,0.15250515937805176

Want als jij niet het idee hebt dat je op een of ander gek dieet staat, is het beter te volgen en zullen de resultaten duurzaam zijn! . Het beste dieet is dan ook het dieet waarvan je niet doorhebt dat je hem volgt! . Mijn doel is altijd om de manier van eten die iemand heeft zo min mogelijk aan te passen! . Ik heb een hekel aan dingen elimineren of verwijderen uit iemands dieet, werkt vrijwel nooit en is in mijn ogen helemaal niet gezond.... . Vaak ook hoe meer restricties je oplegt, hoe kleiner de kans van slagen wordt... . We weten dat, om af te vallen je in een calorietekort moet zitten! . Genoeg van zulke kleine aanpassingen kunnen dus al een gigantisch resultaat opleveren! . Wat is jouw favoriete food swap om af te vallen? . Hulp nodig bij jouw fitness/gezondheidsdoelen?
