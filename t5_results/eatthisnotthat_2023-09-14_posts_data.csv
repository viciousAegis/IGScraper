While I first recommend addressing your diet, lifestyle and getting active these are some supplements that you can consider. To be quite honest, I havent tried any of these personally or in practice, but it is what I was able to find with a little research. Some of these supplements, like cinnamon, wont hurt to add to your diet if you enjoy recipes that call for a little bit of cinnamon  If you do have diabetes please work with your provider to discuss the addition of these supplements so they can go over possible side effects and drug interactions. Never stop taking prescribed medication, let your healthcare provider know what your plan is! You dont want to run into poor outcomes from having dangerously high blood sugar levels. Keep a detailed journal of your numbers, how you feel after certain foods, supplements and medications - so you know what and how things are affecting your body.

3190519680192215501,"Have you heard that electrolytes are important for a successful transition to ketosis? The body needs these minerals to regulate its metabolism. But as we make the metabolic switch to burning fat for energy, the body lets go of retained water, flushing sodium, potassium, and magnesium out with it. The result is electrolyte imbalance and flu-like symptoms that can be easily avoided with proper supplementation. Experts suggest 5000mg sodium, 1000mg potassium, and 400mg magnesium (in glycinate or malate form) per day. Although you can take the one at a time, there are several all-in-one options designed specifically for keto. Redmond Re-Lyte is one we like best. Sweetened with stevia, it contains 810mg sodium, 400mg potassium citrate and 50mg magnesium malate & glycinate per 6g scoop. To compare with another brand, one Liquid I.V. stick pack (6g) contains 11g of added sugars (the first ingredient on the list, followed by dextrose and citric acid) and only 500mg sodium, 370mg potassium, and zero magnesium.

3190307375369845389,"Common Acne Triggers Be mindful of possible acne triggers if you are trying to figure out whats breaking you out! Whey protein: whey protein powders and some muscle-building supplement powders are contaminated with androgenic steroids that may be an issue because they can increase hormone levels in the body for some people Energy drinks: aside from being mostly sugar, energy drinks usually contain B vitamins, which can sometimes irritate the skin and increase acne. Peanuts / peanut butter: contain androgen-like hormones which are found in anything containing peanuts, corn oil, wheat germ, shellfish, organ meats Chlorine: too much pool time can cause acne to worsen and dry out Eggs: eggs are full of progesterone, which is an acne-triggering hormone. Our body naturally produces progesterone, so consuming extra hormones can make your hormone levels react negatively Biotin supplements: biotin increases the amount of skin protein we produce, specifically keratin, which is great for hair and nail growth but too much keratin can be pore clogging. B12 shots: High levels of B12, particularly from supplements, can alter the gene expression of skin bacteria like P. acnes, potentially leading to inflammation and acne. Vapes: Vaping causes dehydration which can impact the production of sebum. When you have dry skin, your body produces more oil that tends to clog your pores and cause acne breakouts Fabric softeners/ Scented detergents: Scented laundry detergents, additives, and fabric softeners leave harmful residues that can irritate sensitive skin, cause contact dermatitis, and worsen acne or eczema. Make sure to also wash your sheets often. Remember, we spend half of our lives in bed! Laying in chemicals is not ideal. Shellfish: foods containing iodides are one of the biggest nutritional culprits for triggering acne breakouts. Shrimp, lobster, crab, crayfish, mussels, and clams are all high in iodine, which, in addition to causing breakouts, can also create the appearance of red splotchy skin",yes,0.16342592239379883

I love making lattes (pictured here) with coffee/espresso as well as matcha. Sometimes I even do half of each in a latte  Both have their benefits and are delicious!  Matcha is made from dried green tea leaves and typically comes in a powder that is mixed into milk or water. Its also great in baked goods!  It has 140 times the antioxidants of coffee and has an amino acid called L-theanine, which promotes the slow release of caffeine. This gives matcha the ability to sustain energy for up to twice as long as coffee.  The energy matcha provides is also a much more calm, alert awareness, that doesnt lend to that jittery feeling coffee can cause.  Coffee is made from ground coffee beans and has up to 3 times the caffeine of matcha. A little bit also adds great flavor to chocolate baked goods and other savory recipes - see my brisket coffee rub on my blog! (in my bio)  It provides a faster spike in energy, but also a faster drop, so it tends to energize for only 1-3 hours. The energy from coffee is also a bit more stimulating, which can cause that jittery feeling for some people.  If you have issues with acid reflux or stomach inflammation, as well as anxiety, I would suggest trying matcha if you want caffeine!  I drink both depending on what I need - If im really sleepy, matcha doesnt always to the trick.  I hope this was helpful! Which one do you prefer? . . . . . . . .",Yes,0.16198110580444336

Keep in mind, just because you implement these hacksdoesn't necessarily mean you will lose weight  They are just steps in the right direction that can aid the process.   Remember, when it comes to fat loss, creating a calorie deficit (burning more calories than you take in via food) is always priority numero uno.  As you look on this list, you will see that these tips are all based around controlling energy balance in some way (except pizzabecause pizza is delicious ).   Smaller Plates: Using smaller plates can help with the whole well, its in front of me, I might as well eat it all conundrum.   Coffee: As long as youre only adding minimal amounts of cream/sugar or drinking it black, coffee can be a great option to curb hunger & give you a nice energy boost.   Strawberries: For reference here, a whole pound of strawberries is only 150 calories. You can eat half a pound of strawberries for 75 caloriestalk about feeling full & satisfied!  Sparkling Water: Zero calorie drinks can be a great option to hold you over between meals. Sometimes just giving yourself something different that plain water to sip on can make a noticeable difference.   Step Goals: Setting a daily step goal can help to increase daily activity levels and burn additional calories, without actually feeling like you have to add dedicated time to your day for exercise. Go for a walk, park at the back of the parking lot, get up from your desk every 30 minutes, etc.   Pizza: As surprised as you may be to see pizza make the list, it absolutely can be a fat loss hack. For many, being able to occasionally incorporate foods you enjoy (like pizza) into your plan can help big time when it comes to sustainability and actually adhering to your diet.

Widely available in many supermarket chains, Applegate's hickory-smoked, no sugar, uncured bacon contains pork, water, sea salt, and celery powder (in lieu of chemicals to cure). We give this product a green light for keto, although we'd like to see the added quality factors of pasture-raised and pesticide-free feed on this label as well. Other brands in this category include Pederson's, Wellshire, and a local farm near you! The Great Value brand (aka Walmart) gives us pause because of the pork cured with sodium phosphates, sodium erythorbate (what on earth is that???), and sodium nitrite used to preserve the product. Big Food manufacturers use chemical preservatives to enhance color and flavor, to extend shelf life, and to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria. Needless to say, these ingredients are not ideal for your body. If you're aiming for a clean, nutrient-dense, and well formulated approach to keto food, make sure to choose uncured bacon from pastured pigs. In our opinion, it's always best to support a local farm that you know is raising animals right, but the Applegate option is not a bad choice, in a pinch. ",yes,0.14954328536987305

3185075263507117591,"I have such a huge sweet tooth. Id eat it all day if I could so when clients complain about sugar cravings  I totally empathize.  The key to sugar cravings is balancing what your body is ACTUALLY craving (which is usually quick energy, minerals, protein or water). So to keep sugar cravings at bay dont skip meals and try adding more protein to your diet (most of us need about 90g or more depending on lifestyle). I use protein smoothies but a protein bar could be a good option too (just check the ingredients!)  Heres what happens when I want candy  I usually eat a piece of dark chocolate first. Like 1-2 squares. If that doesnt work I move over to fruit or veggies with a protein (eg. berries with Greek yogurt, carrots with hummus).   To avoid the cravings I include the healthy fats everyday  fish, avocado, nuts. And to end my day I drink herbal teas. Water is also key so try increasing your water because your body can misinterpret thirst for something sweet!  ",No,0.15567898750305176

Its my favourite season for fashion: flannels, Jordans, jeans - cant go wrong in my books.  Dont get me wrong, I do love the summer but Im ready for this transition period.  Now that the long weekend is upon us, Here are some quick tips to avoid weight gain (notice I said weight and not fat)  1) Majority of your plate with protein. It is most filling and will keep your metabolism revving because of the high thermic effect.  2) More veggies than starches. This also helps keep you full without too many extra calories.  3) If you know what is being served, or at least have a rough idea, you can log your meal in advance. While you dont have to weigh everything out, its definitely a good idea to overestimate and guess portion sizes to the best of your ability.  4) Be okay with saying no. Family members can be the harshest people to those trying to transform their bodies. Youre allowed to say no to them. Briefly explain why youre saying no if you want to and move on from the situation. Your journey is more important than family members' expectations of what you should be doing.  You don't have to do extra workouts, you don't have to annihilate your calories this coming week.   If your scale goes up, it's definitely not fat. And it's definitely not a big deal.

3182345561432851075,"Ever heard someone dismiss intuitive eating as just eating whatever you want or giving into cravings? I'm here to tell you that this couldn't be further from the truth!  Intuitive eating is all about listening to your body's needs, developing a healthy relationship with food, and nourishing yourself in a way that feels good both physically and emotionally. Its not a diet or a strict set of rules. Instead, it is a process of self-discovery that involves tuning into your body's signals of hunger, fullness, and satisfaction, and learning to trust and honor those signals. It means letting go of strict food rules and restrictions, and instead allowing yourself to eat a wide variety of foods that support your wellbeing physically, mentally, and emotionally (aka not JUST high-nutrient foods, also foods that bring you pleasure regardless of their nutritional makeup). Intuitive eating prioritizes a healthy relationship with food, which means letting go of guilt and shame around food choices and instead approaching eating with curiosity, flexibility, and self-compassion. The beauty of intuitive eating is that it can support holistic health-- in other words, not just physical health but also mental and emotional wellbeing. Plus, people often find once they start regularly attuning to their intuition around food and movement, they often begin to discover other aspects of their intuition that perhaps they had been ignoring (like realizing they need some better boundaries at work, or in certain relationships, for example). Have you been hesitant to try eating intuitively? Why or why not? * * * * * *",No,0.15464019775390625

Keep in mind, just because you implement these hacksdoesn't necessarily mean you will lose weight  They are just steps in the right direction that can aid the process.   Remember, when it comes to fat loss, creating a calorie deficit (burning more calories than you take in via food) is always priority numero uno.  As you look on this list, you will see that these tips are all based around controlling energy balance in some way (except pizzabecause pizza is delicious ).   Smaller Plates: Using smaller plates can help with the whole well, its in front of me, I might as well eat it all conundrum.   Coffee: As long as youre only adding minimal amounts of cream/sugar or drinking it black, coffee can be a great option to curb hunger & give you a nice energy boost.

Step Goals: Setting a daily step goal can help to increase daily activity levels and burn additional calories, without actually feeling like you have to add dedicated time to your day for exercise. Go for a walk, park at the back of the parking lot, get up from your desk every 30 minutes, etc.   Pizza: As surprised as you may be to see pizza make the list, it absolutely can be a fat loss hack.

Creamy, crunchy, salty, sweet, and savory  they're like the VIPs of taste sensations that make us love what we eat. Identify your craving, then go from there!  You can still get that satisfaction by choosing alternatives that fit the same category. Here are some cool ideas to try: 1. Try almonds, carrots or celery instead of chips or pretzels. There is still a crunch, but the nutrients are higher in the healthy stuff. 2. Reach for flavored water instead of soda. Add a splash of fruit juice, lime, lemon, fresh fruit or mint. 3. Choose hummus or avocado instead of mayo on a sandwich. Get the creamy and moist texture with higher quality foods. 4. Munch on a sweet potato with cinnamon instead of cake. Get the sugar fix without the empty calories. 5. Enjoy some plain yogurt swirled with vanilla and honey instead of artificially flavored yogurt or ice cream. 6. Snack on grapes, apples, peaches, dried mango or other fruit instead of candy to satisfy the sweet tooth. 7. Indulge in a piece of dark chocolate or a nuts-only bar instead of a candy bar.

You won't be able to substitute one-for-one, since almond flour doesn't have the binding capability of gluten, and it's also higher in fat.
