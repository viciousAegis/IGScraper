The macros are also quite similar, however the Sanitarium brand contains a little bit more protein & slightly less fats, carbs and significantly less sodium. Another reason as to why i make this swap - the Sanitarium natural peanut butter contains 100% peanuts & nothing else. so yes it contains fats as this is due to the natural fats in peanuts.

And the calorie & macro difference is insane for this simple swap so its a no-brainer for me! Imean i doubt anyone is going to have 100mL of maple syrup in one serving... but the Green's brand's serving size is 1SmL. Sorry but who has ONLY 1SmL of maple syrup in one serving!?
