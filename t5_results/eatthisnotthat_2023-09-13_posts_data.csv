3190519680192215501,"Have you heard that electrolytes are important for a successful transition to ketosis? The body needs these minerals to regulate its metabolism. But as we make the metabolic switch to burning fat for energy, the body lets go of retained water, flushing sodium, potassium, and magnesium out with it. The result is electrolyte imbalance and flu-like symptoms that can be easily avoided with proper supplementation. Experts suggest 5000mg sodium, 1000mg potassium, and 400mg magnesium (in glycinate or malate form) per day. Although you can take the one at a time, there are several all-in-one options designed specifically for keto. Redmond Re-Lyte is one of these. Sweetened with stevia, it contains 810mg sodium, 400mg potassium citrate and 50mg magnesium malate & glycinate per 6g scoop. To compare with another brand, one Liquid I.V. stick pack (6g) contains 11g of added sugars (the first ingredient on the list, followed by dextrose and citric acid) and only 500mg sodium, 370mg potassium, and zero magnesium.

3190307375369845389,"Common Acne Triggers Be mindful of possible acne triggers if you are trying to figure out whats breaking you out! Whey protein: whey protein powders and some muscle-building supplement powders are contaminated with androgenic steroids that may be an issue because they can increase hormone levels in the body for some people Energy drinks: aside from being mostly sugar, energy drinks usually contain B vitamins, which can sometimes irritate the skin and increase acne. Peanuts / peanut butter: contain androgen-like hormones which are found in anything containing peanuts, corn oil, wheat germ, shellfish, organ meats Chlorine: too much pool time can cause acne to worsen and dry out Eggs: eggs are full of progesterone, which is an acne-triggering hormone. Our body naturally produces progesterone, so consuming extra hormones can make your hormone levels react negatively Biotin supplements: biotin increases the amount of skin protein we produce, specifically keratin, which is great for hair and nail growth but too much keratin can be pore clogging. B12 shots: High levels of B12, particularly from supplements, can alter the gene expression of skin bacteria like P. acnes, potentially leading to inflammation and acne. Vapes: Vaping causes dehydration which can impact the production of sebum. When you have dry skin, your body produces more oil that tends to clog your pores and cause acne breakouts Fabric softeners/ Scented detergents: Scented laundry detergents, additives, and fabric softeners leave harmful residues that can irritate sensitive skin, cause contact dermatitis, and worsen acne or eczema. Make sure to also wash your sheets often. Remember, we spend half of our lives in bed! Laying in chemicals is not ideal. Shellfish: foods containing iodides are one of the biggest nutritional culprits for triggering acne breakouts. Shrimp, lobster, crab, crayfish, mussels, and clams are all high in iodine, which, in addition to causing breakouts, can also create the appearance of red splotchy skin",yes,0.15655231475830078

I love making lattes (pictured here) with coffee/espresso as well as matcha. Sometimes I even do half of each in a latte  Both have their benefits and are delicious!  Matcha is made from dried green tea leaves and typically comes in a powder that is mixed into milk or water. Its also great in baked goods!  It has 140 times the antioxidants of coffee and has an amino acid called L-theanine, which promotes the slow release of caffeine. This gives matcha the ability to sustain energy for up to twice as long as coffee.  The energy matcha provides is also a much more calm, alert awareness, that doesnt lend to that jittery feeling coffee can cause.  Coffee is made from ground coffee beans and has up to 3 times the caffeine of matcha. A little bit also adds great flavor to chocolate baked goods and other savory recipes - see my brisket coffee rub on my blog! (in my bio)  It provides a faster spike in energy, but also a faster drop, so it tends to energize for only 1-3 hours. The energy from coffee is also a bit more stimulating, which can cause that jittery feeling for some people.  If you have issues with acid reflux or stomach inflammation, as well as anxiety, I would suggest trying matcha if you want caffeine!  I drink both depending on what I need - If im really sleepy, matcha doesnt always to the trick.  I hope this was helpful! Which one do you prefer? . . . . . . . .",Yes,0.15450096130371094

Keep in mind, just because you implement these hacksdoesn't necessarily mean you will lose weight  They are just steps in the right direction that can aid the process.   Remember, when it comes to fat loss, creating a calorie deficit (burning more calories than you take in via food) is always priority numero uno.  As you look on this list, you will see that these tips are all based around controlling energy balance in some way (except pizzabecause pizza is delicious ).   Smaller Plates: Using smaller plates can help with the whole well, its in front of me, I might as well eat it all conundrum.   Coffee: As long as youre only adding minimal amounts of cream/sugar or drinking it black, coffee can be a great option to curb hunger & give you a nice energy boost.   Strawberries: For reference here, a whole pound of strawberries is only 150 calories. You can eat half a pound of strawberries for 75 caloriestalk about feeling full & satisfied!  Sparkling Water: Zero calorie drinks can be a great option to hold you over between meals. Sometimes just giving yourself something different that plain water to sip on can make a noticeable difference.   Step Goals: Setting a daily step goal can help to increase daily activity levels and burn additional calories, without actually feeling like you have to add dedicated time to your day for exercise. Go for a walk, park at the back of the parking lot, get up from your desk every 30 minutes, etc.   Pizza: As surprised as you may be to see pizza make the list, it absolutely can be a fat loss hack. For many, being able to occasionally incorporate foods you enjoy (like pizza) into your plan can help big time when it comes to sustainability and actually adhering to your diet.

Widely available in many supermarket chains, Applegate's hickory-smoked, no sugar, uncured bacon contains pork, water, sea salt, and celery powder (in lieu of chemicals to cure). We give this product a green light for keto, although we'd like to see the added quality factors of pasture-raised and pesticide-free feed on this label as well. Other brands in this category include Pederson's, Wellshire, and a local farm near you! The Great Value brand (aka Walmart) gives us pause because of the pork cured with sodium phosphates, sodium erythorbate (what on earth is that???), and sodium nitrite used to preserve the product. Big Food manufacturers use chemical preservatives to enhance color and flavor, to extend shelf life, and to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria. Needless to say, these ingredients are not ideal for your body. If you're aiming for a clean, nutrient-dense, and well formulated approach to keto food, make sure to choose uncured bacon from pastured pigs.

I use protein smoothies but a protein bar could be a good option too (just check the ingredients!)  Heres what happens when I want candy  I usually eat a piece of dark chocolate first. Like 1-2 squares. If that doesnt work I move over to fruit or veggies with a protein (eg. berries with Greek yogurt, carrots with hummus).

Its my favourite season for fashion: flannels, Jordans, jeans - cant go wrong in my books.  Dont get me wrong, I do love the summer but Im ready for this transition period.  Now that the long weekend is upon us, Here are some quick tips to avoid weight gain (notice I said weight and not fat)  1) Majority of your plate with protein. It is most filling and will keep your metabolism revving because of the high thermic effect.  2) More veggies than starches. This also helps keep you full without too many extra calories.  3) If you know what is being served, or at least have a rough idea, you can log your meal in advance. While you dont have to weigh everything out, its definitely a good idea to overestimate and guess portion sizes to the best of your ability.  4) Be okay with saying no. Family members can be the harshest people to those trying to transform their bodies. Youre allowed to say no to them. Briefly explain why youre saying no if you want to and move on from the situation. Your journey is more important than family members' expectations of what you should be doing.  You don't have to do extra workouts, you don't have to annihilate your calories this coming week.   If your scale goes up, it's definitely not fat. And it's definitely not a big deal.

3182345561432851075,"Ever heard someone dismiss intuitive eating as just eating whatever you want or giving into cravings? I'm here to tell you that this couldn't be further from the truth!  Intuitive eating is all about listening to your body's needs, developing a healthy relationship with food, and nourishing yourself in a way that feels good both physically and emotionally. Its not a diet or a strict set of rules. Instead, it is a process of self-discovery that involves tuning into your body's signals of hunger, fullness, and satisfaction, and learning to trust and honor those signals. It means letting go of strict food rules and restrictions, and instead allowing yourself to eat a wide variety of foods that support your wellbeing physically, mentally, and emotionally (aka not JUST high-nutrient foods, also foods that bring you pleasure regardless of their nutritional makeup). Intuitive eating prioritizes a healthy relationship with food, which means letting go of guilt and shame around food choices and instead approaching eating with curiosity, flexibility, and self-compassion. The beauty of intuitive eating is that it can support holistic health-- in other words, not just physical health but also mental and emotional wellbeing. Plus, people often find once they start regularly attuning to their intuition around food and movement, they often begin to discover other aspects of their intuition that perhaps they had been ignoring (like realizing they need some better boundaries at work, or in certain relationships, for example). Have you been hesitant to try eating intuitively? Why or why not? * * * * * *",No,0.15056991577148438

Keep in mind, just because you implement these hacksdoesn't necessarily mean you will lose weight  They are just steps in the right direction that can aid the process.   Remember, when it comes to fat loss, creating a calorie deficit (burning more calories than you take in via food) is always priority numero uno.  As you look on this list, you will see that these tips are all based around controlling energy balance in some way (except pizzabecause pizza is delicious ).   Smaller Plates: Using smaller plates can help with the whole well, its in front of me, I might as well eat it all conundrum.   Coffee: As long as youre only adding minimal amounts of cream/sugar or drinking it black, coffee can be a great option to curb hunger & give you a nice energy boost.   Strawberries: For reference here, a whole pound of strawberries is only 150 calories. You can eat half a pound of strawberries for 75 caloriestalk about feeling full & satisfied!  Sparkling Water: Zero calorie drinks can be a great option to hold you over between meals. Sometimes just giving yourself something different that plain water to sip on can make a noticeable difference.   Step Goals: Setting a daily step goal can help to increase daily activity levels and burn additional calories, without actually feeling like you have to add dedicated time to your day for exercise. Go for a walk, park at the back of the parking lot, get up from your desk every 30 minutes, etc.   Pizza: As surprised as you may be to see pizza make the list, it absolutely can be a fat loss hack.
